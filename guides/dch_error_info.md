When attempting to run docker-compose, I was presented with the following error

```shell
error getting credentials - err: exec: "docker-credential-desktop": executable file not found in $PATH, out: `` 
```

The ultimate answer to this issue turned out to be so simple. Update the permissions of the file to allow for execution. chmod u+x. 

All of the other options that follow may have value for some in some cases so I'll leave that info here for a just-in-case scenario.

Below is supposed to be a command that would check for and install a credential helper.
The command wouldn't run for whatever reason so the below is another way to work around this issue.

```shell
docker-credential-secretservice version 0.6.5 < /dev/null > /dev/null 2>&1 || \
docker plugin install --grant-all-permissions \ 
docker-credential-secretservice
```

# Response by ChatGPT:
The command I provided is specific to Docker's credential helper for the SecretService. Since it didn't work for you, it's likely that the SecretService credential helper is not supported or installed in Colima.

Instead, we can try a different approach to resolve the "docker-credential-desktop" error in Colima. Please try the following:

# Step 1: Check Docker Configuration
Make sure that your Docker configuration in Colima is set up correctly. Check if there are any specific credential helper configurations set in the Docker configuration files. These files are usually located in the /etc/docker or /etc/colima/docker directories. Ensure that there are no conflicting or misconfigured settings related to credential helpers.

# Step 2: Use the docker-credential-none Helper (Workaround)
If Docker credential helpers are not working as expected in Colima, you can use the docker-credential-none helper as a workaround. This helper doesn't actually store or retrieve credentials but simply returns an empty response to satisfy Docker's expectations. Keep in mind that this approach is not secure and should be used only for testing or in a trusted environment.

To use docker-credential-none as the helper, you can create a symbolic link to it with the name "docker-credential-desktop" in a directory that is in your $PATH. Run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
sudo ln -s /bin/true /usr/local/bin/docker-credential-desktop
```

This creates a symbolic link from /bin/true (which is a command that returns a successful exit status without doing anything) to /usr/local/bin/docker-credential-desktop. As a result, Docker will use the docker-credential-none helper as "docker-credential-desktop," which should bypass the error related to the missing credential helper.

# Step 3: Restart Colima
After creating the symbolic link, restart the Colima service to apply the changes:

```shell
colima restart
```

To remove the symbolic link in the future, you can use the unlink command. The unlink command is used to remove a symbolic link (also known as a "symlink") from the filesystem. Here's the command to remove the symbolic link we created earlier:

```shell
sudo unlink /usr/local/bin/docker-credential-desktop
```

Most of what is above here is merely interesting and hasn't really solved my problem. Let's start over so to speak.
The definitive source for all things docker-credential-helpers is located at this URL:
https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers

My real problem is I have my $PATH all f'd up and I don't really understand $PATH to begin with.
I'm using ZSH as my shell and from what I've gleaned, Bash and ZSH both have different $PATHs and so if you ever did anything in under Bash and then switched, you're kinda fucked! 

I learned a lot about working with the $PATH environment variable through this process and I think my $PATH is now cleaned up properly.
