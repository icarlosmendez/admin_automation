This document is intended to serve as a basic road map to the components I would like to have on my Proxmox server and the order of operations I should employ in the setup and configuration of said server.

# Components:
Proxmox VE - Hypervisor and host OS (Ubuntu)
ZFS - File System and Hard Drive manager provided by Proxmox (Ubuntu)
Bind - DNS Server provided by Proxmox (Ubuntu)
Postfix - Mail Server provided by Proxmox (Ubuntu)

# Containerized Micro-Services:
Samba - File Server
Apache - Web Server
nGinX - Web/Reverse Proxy Server
PostgreSQL - Database Server
Mongo - Database Server
Git - Local code repository
CI/CD - Jenkins server
Alpine or other lightweight Linux distro - Host for running local AI LLM's (lmstudio.ai, Open Interpreter)
Monitoring - YTBD
PfSense - Firewall


# Because ChatGPT sessions can take longer than you want and even wander during, I had to ask
I want to capture the outline that we are working on so in the event we lose state in this conversation context I can reintroduce anything necessary to ensure that we continue down a proper path. Do you expect to rewrite the outline everytime I add to the conversation? I realize we need to flesh out a lot of concepts before we start building anything, I just want to make sure that in the event of a reconsideration of various topics, things we aren't talking about don't morph. Your thoughts?

It's a thoughtful consideration to ensure continuity and clarity as we navigate through the complexities of your project. To maintain coherence and prevent loss of context or inadvertent modifications to our foundational plan, I propose the following approach:

# Establish a Core Outline: 
We’ll maintain a core outline that encapsulates the essential components and steps of your project. This outline will serve as our anchor, ensuring that any adjustments or additional details we discuss are enhancements rather than transformations of our original plan.

# Versioning and Iterative Refinement: 
As we delve into specific topics and incorporate your feedback and decisions, I will explicitly mark these as refinements or extensions to our core outline. Think of it as versioning: we keep the original structure but iterate on it as we flesh out more details. This way, the evolution of our plan is transparent and trackable.

# Documenting Decisions and Alternatives: 
When we make a decision or consider alternatives, I'll note these down. This ensures that we have a record of why certain choices were made and what alternatives were considered, allowing for easy revisitation if needed.

# Save Points: 
Periodically, or upon reaching significant milestones, I’ll summarize our progress and the current state of the roadmap. This serves as a "save point," allowing us to have a snapshot of where we are in the planning process. You can use these summaries as a reference for our discussions or in case we need to re-establish context in future conversations.

With your approval of this approach, I'll ensure that our discussions enrich the roadmap without drifting from the foundational goals and strategies we’ve set. Additionally, this method allows us to adapt and incorporate new insights or reconsiderations effectively.

## Strategy conversation with ChatGPT 4

# 1. LXC-Based Virtualization and Container Strategy: 
Design an LXC-centric approach for deploying your services, considering the division between stateful and stateless applications to optimize for performance and ease of management.

# 2. Network Architecture and Security: 
With LXC containers and a focus on flexibility, we'll need to ensure that the network architecture supports isolation and security at various levels. This includes leveraging Proxmox's built-in networking features and possibly integrating additional firewall or VLAN configurations for enhanced security.

# 3. Ansible for Automation and Configuration: 
Identify key tasks and configurations that can be automated via Ansible playbooks. This step includes setting up your LXC containers, configuring services, and ensuring that security policies are applied consistently.

# 4. Monitoring and Security Framework: 
Decide on a monitoring solution that integrates well with your LXC environment and addresses both performance metrics and security alerts. Additionally, establish a baseline for security practices, including updates, patches, and access controls.

# 5. Documentation and Continuous Improvement: 
Document your infrastructure setup, configuration processes, and operational procedures. This documentation will be vital for maintenance and future enhancements, providing a roadmap for adapting to new technologies or scaling the infrastructure.
